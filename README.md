# 🚀 StoryForge — Interactive Storytelling Platform

**Author:** Stuti

StoryForge is a full-stack MERN application that enables users to create, publish, and explore interactive stories with dynamic content unlocking. Unlike traditional reading platforms, StoryForge introduces a progression-based storytelling experience where readers unlock hidden artifacts while reading chapters.

This project demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development, authentication systems, protected routing, dynamic content management, and interactive UI design.
